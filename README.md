# Pastemonkey

Pastemonkey was my attempt at a much better pastebin app. At the time, most pastebin apps were rather simple affairs.

While Pastemonkey is abandoned, it has some early attempts at features which are now in tools like Github and Gist such
as inline commenting and auto-detection of language.

This project has been abandoned for many years and is here for archive purposes only.
