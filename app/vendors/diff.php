	About:
	I searched a function to compare arrays and the array_diff()
	was not specific enough. It ignores the order of the array-values.
	So I reimplemented the diff-function which is found on unix-systems
	but this you can use directly in your code and adopt for your needs.
	Simply adopt the $this->formatline-function. with the third-parameter of arr_diff()
	you can hide matching lines. Hope someone has use for this.
